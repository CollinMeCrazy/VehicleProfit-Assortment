PROJECT TITLE: Vehicle Profit Assortment

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Takes in data files to read and sort information. Data is created into objects that hold destination, income, and type of vehicle. Boat, Train, and Coach are all under the Class Vehicle, which shares some instance variables. Profit and loss is calculated for each type of vehicle, and all vehicles are listed out in an unsorted and sorted list in the report. The sorted list is specified in order of each location by first Train, then Boat, and last Coach. All profits and losses are calculated into a total.
